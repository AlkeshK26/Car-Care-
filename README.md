CarCare Pro: Multi-Tenant Car Detailing Ecosystem
📌 Project Overview
CarCare Pro is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between car service providers (Garages) and vehicle owners. The platform operates as a multi-tenant ecosystem, providing dedicated interfaces for Administrators, Garage Owners, and Customers to handle end-to-end service workflows—from appointment booking to live job tracking.

🎯 Project Objectives

Digitize Garage Operations: To empower small-to-medium garage owners with digital tools for managing service menus and live appointments.

Enhance Transparency: To offer real-time status updates to customers regarding their vehicle’s service lifecycle.

🛠️ Technical Stack & Tools
Frontend: React.js (Functional Components, Hooks).

Styling: Custom Inline CSS (Optimized for cross-browser consistency and high-performance rendering).

Backend: Node.js & Express.js (RESTful API Architecture).

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexible schema management.

Security: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and Bcrypt.js for data encryption.

Version Control: Git & GitHub.
